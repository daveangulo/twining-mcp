# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Agents share *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was done -- eliminating information silos across context windows.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Git Commit Linking

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 6 (Git Commit Linking)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Roadmap created for v1.1 (phases 4-6)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v1.1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6 (v1)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | — | — |
| 2. Intelligence | 2 | — | — |
| 3. Graph + Lifecycle | 2 | — | — |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1 completed in 1 day (6 plans)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

v1.1 decisions:
- Serena integration via CLAUDE.md workflow pattern (agent-mediated, no direct MCP-to-MCP coupling)
- GSD bridge is bidirectional: planning state feeds context assembly AND decisions sync to planning docs
- Git linking is bidirectional: decisions reference commits, commits queryable for decisions
- Phase 4 (git linking) before Phase 5 (GSD bridge) because git linking modifies the Decision data model

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
