# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Agents share *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was done -- eliminating information silos across context windows.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Integrations + Polish — GSD bridge, git linking, Serena workflow, search_decisions, export.

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Status: Defining requirements for v1.1
Last activity: 2026-02-16 -- Milestone v1.1 started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v1.1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

v1.1 decisions:
- Serena integration via CLAUDE.md workflow pattern (agent-mediated, no direct MCP-to-MCP coupling)
- GSD bridge is bidirectional: planning state feeds context assembly AND decisions sync to planning docs
- Git linking is bidirectional: decisions reference commits, commits queryable for decisions

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
