  "summary": "Replace search bar multi-select with toggle chips, add search icon, and style filters to match toolbar design language",
  "context": "The global search bar visible on every dashboard page used a raw HTML select-multiple for type filtering, bare date inputs, and inconsistent styling compared to the refined toolbar patterns established in the timeline and graph views.",
  "rationale": "Toggle chips match the filter pattern used in timeline domain filters and graph type filters, providing a consistent UX. Pill-shaped input with embedded search/clear icons is more modern. Custom-styled select and labeled date inputs improve visual cohesion. All changes are CSS/HTML/JS only with no new dependencies.",

  "alternatives": [
    {
      "option": "Keep select-multiple but restyle it with CSS",
      "pros": [],
      "cons": [],
      "reason_rejected": "Multi-select elements have very limited cross-browser styling support; even with CSS overrides the native widget shows through on many browsers"

    {
      "option": "Use a dropdown menu with checkboxes for type selection",
      "pros": [],
      "cons": [],
      "reason_rejected": "Adds unnecessary interaction complexity (click to open, then check); toggle chips are visible at a glance and match the established pattern in timeline/graph toolbars"
