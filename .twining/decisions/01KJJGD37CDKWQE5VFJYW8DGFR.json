  "summary": "Add Stream View as alternate visualization for Blackboard tab",
  "context": "The Blackboard tab only has a plain data table, unlike Decisions (Timeline) and Graph (Visual). Blackboard data is fundamentally a multi-agent conversation with 10 entry types, relates_to links, and scope hierarchy — all flattened into rows.",
  "rationale": "A vertical card-based activity stream best fits the conversational nature of blackboard data. Cards colored by entry type, grouped by time, with CSS thread lines for relates_to connections. Visually distinct from Timeline (horizontal time bands) and Graph (node network). Scales well for dozens-to-hundreds of entries kept active by archival.",
