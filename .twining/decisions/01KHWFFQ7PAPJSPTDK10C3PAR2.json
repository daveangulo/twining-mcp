  "context": "User wants a demo video showcasing all Twining capabilities. We have existing dashboard screenshots and a complete v1.3 implementation (28 MCP tools, web dashboard, agent coordination, verification). Need to demonstrate practical value through a realistic scenario.",
  "rationale": "Demo should follow a narrative arc showing how agents use Twining throughout a realistic development workflow. Better to show the \"why\" (solving real coordination problems) rather than just feature enumeration. Will use a multi-agent scenario where agents coordinate on adding authentication to a web app, demonstrating blackboard, decisions, knowledge graph, context assembly, verification, and handoffs.",
