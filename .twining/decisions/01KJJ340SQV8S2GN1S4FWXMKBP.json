  "summary": "Redesign dashboard UI with dark-first professional theme using Sora/DM Sans/JetBrains Mono fonts and teal accent color",
  "context": "The dashboard UI was using generic system fonts, basic blue accent, and a light-first design. User requested a professional UI that can be extended with new functionality. Three bugs also needed fixing: project name showing '.' for relative paths, tabs not closing on session end, and duplicate tabs opening.",
  "rationale": "Dark-first design matches developer tool context (terminal/IDE environments). Sora provides geometric, modern headings; DM Sans is clean and readable for body text; JetBrains Mono is the definitive developer monospace font. Teal accent (#00d4aa) is distinctive without being generic blue. CSS custom properties throughout enable easy theming and extension.",
