  "context": "Plugin changes were shipping without version bumps, making it impossible to track what version users have. Need CI enforcement to prevent this.",
  "rationale": "Added plugin-version-check job that only runs on PRs (not pushes to main, since direct commits happen). Uses git diff to detect plugin/ changes and checks both version files for version line changes. Excludes plugin.json itself from the \"changed files\" check to avoid false positives when only the version is bumped.",
