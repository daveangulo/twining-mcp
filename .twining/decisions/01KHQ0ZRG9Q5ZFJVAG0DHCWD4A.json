  "context": "External architecture review raised 14 findings across divergences and code quality. Evaluated each against actual codebase state and project planning history.",
  "rationale": "Findings validated by reading actual implementation code via Serena. Scope-expansion items (divergences 5-6) are invalid because they were intentional milestone additions. Dashboard opt-out (CQ7) is partially invalid since env-var controls already exist. Pending-hooks (divergence 3) was explicitly deferred in project planning. The remaining 7 findings are confirmed real gaps.",
