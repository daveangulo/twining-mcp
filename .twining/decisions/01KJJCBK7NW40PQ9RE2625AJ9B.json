  "summary": "Fix timeline zoom by changing overflow:auto to overflow:hidden and add zoom controls toolbar",
  "context": "The timeline view under the Decisions tab had a zoom bug: once zoomed in, users couldn't zoom back out to see a larger timescale. The root cause was overflow:auto on #timeline-container which created a scrollable container that intercepted scroll wheel events before vis-timeline could process them for zoom.",
  "rationale": "overflow:hidden lets vis-timeline handle all scroll/zoom internally without interference. Added explicit zoom controls (zoom in/out, fit all, jump to now) as a secondary zoom mechanism so users are never stuck. Also added domain swim lanes, domain filter chips, gradient confidence-coded items, custom dark tooltips, and entrance animations for visual polish.",
