  "summary": "Add rigor framework: verify step in agent lifecycle, tested_by traceability, drift detection, checkable constraints",
  "context": "Chad Fowler's 'Relocating Rigor' identifies that when AI generates code, discipline must move from generation to evaluation — 'probabilistic inside, deterministic at the edges.' The agent integration architecture had a fully advisory lifecycle with no verification gates, meaning coordination could look rigorous while code silently drifted from decisions.",
  "rationale": "The agent lifecycle needed a verify step as a deterministic edge between decide and handoff. Six mechanisms form a hierarchy from convention (tests pass) through low-effort additions (assembly tracking, tested_by queries) to new tooling (drift detection, checkable constraints). This relocates rigor from 'agents should follow the lifecycle' to 'the system makes failures visible when they don't.' The tested_by relation type already exists in the knowledge graph but was unused — activating it is the highest-leverage change.",
