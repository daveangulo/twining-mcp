  "summary": "Implement Twining as a Claude Code plugin with skills, hooks, agents, commands, and MCP server instructions",
  "context": "Installing Twining currently requires 3+ manual steps. The Claude Code plugin system collapses this into a single install that bundles MCP server, skills, hooks, agents, and commands. Skills teach Claude when to use Twining autonomously.",
  "rationale": "Plugin provides one-step install, behavioral teaching via skills (not just documentation), auto-starting MCP server, and lifecycle hooks. Skills are mapped to cover all 27 tools across 7 skills. MCP server instructions provide a fallback for non-Claude-Code clients.",
  "constraints": [],
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "option": "Keep manual install only with improved docs",

      "cons": [],
      "reason_rejected": "Requires users to copy CLAUDE.md template, configure hooks, and add MCP server separately — high friction"

    {
      "option": "Ship skills as a separate npm package",
      "pros": [],
      "cons": [],
      "reason_rejected": "Skills need to be bundled with the MCP server config to provide the one-step install experience"
