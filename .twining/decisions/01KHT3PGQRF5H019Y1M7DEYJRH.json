  "summary": "Agent integration architecture doc recommends Claude Code + Twining as primary path, blackboard over orchestrator",
  "context": "User asked for research on which agent frameworks work best with Twining. A previous session generated an inaccurate multi-repo orchestrator design that proposed the anti-pattern the user rejected. Needed a grounded, opinionated analysis verified against actual codebase.",
  "rationale": "Claude Code + Twining MCP scores 15/15 because Claude Code is both MCP host and SWE agent natively, Twining provides persistent shared state through standard MCP tools, and subagents inherit connections automatically. Blackboard coordination fits MCP's request/response model (no push channel for orchestrator assignment), survives context resets (decisions persist in files), and enables token-budgeted selective injection. Academic research (LbMAS 2025) validates blackboard outperforming orchestrator patterns for LLM agents.",
