  "summary": "Add twining_dismiss tool for targeted removal of blackboard entries by ID",
  "context": "All 8 blackboard warnings were false positives from automatic conflict detection, but there was no tool to remove specific entries. The only removal mechanism was twining_archive which sweeps by timestamp and affects all entry types.",
  "rationale": "Added dismiss at three layers: BlackboardStore.dismiss (lock, read, filter, rewrite with proper-lockfile), BlackboardEngine.dismiss (delegates to store, cleans up embeddings), and twining_dismiss tool (accepts ids array + optional reason). Follows the same lock-read-rewrite pattern as the archiver. The reason parameter is accepted but not stored — it serves as documentation in the tool call itself.",

      "reason_rejected": "Archiver's purpose is time-based bulk cleanup. Targeted ID removal is a different concern that belongs on the store/engine."

      "reason_rejected": "Adds complexity (filter dismissed entries everywhere). The entries are low-value noise — actual removal is simpler and matches user intent."
